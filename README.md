# Phonauto: From Sound to Music

Phonauto is a web-based application that redefines music creation, making it as intuitive as humming a tune. In a world where Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) present a steep learning curve, Phonauto breaks down the barriers, allowing anyone with a musical idea to bring it to life. Our philosophy is simple: to augment human creativity, not replace it.

The name **Phonauto** is inspired by the *phonautograph*, the earliest known device for recording sound. Just as the phonautograph first translated sound into a visual medium, Phonauto translates your raw musical ideas—a hummed melody, a beatboxed rhythm, a described vibe—into structured, fully-editable music.

## The Core Experience

Phonauto is built on a simple yet powerful workflow:

1.  **Create**: Hum a melody into your microphone, and our `hum2melody` model transcribes it into musical notes. Beatbox a rhythm, and `beatbox2drums` converts it into a drum pattern. Describe the style or mood you want, and our `Arranger` crafts a full-band accompaniment.
2.  **Refine**: Edit every aspect of your creation. Dive into our custom music DSL in a Monaco-based code editor, make precise adjustments in the interactive Piano Roll and Timeline, or tweak the final sound in the professional-grade Mixer.
3.  **Play**: Hear your ideas come to life instantly with our client-side audio engine, powered by Tone.js.

## The Technology: A Symphony of Three Parts

Phonauto's architecture is a carefully orchestrated system of three distinct services, each with a specialized role.

### 🧠 The AI Brain: The Backend

Built with **FastAPI**, our backend is the intelligent core of Phonauto, housing our custom-trained AI models and the creative Arranger.

-   **`hum2melody`**: A state-of-the-art pitch detection model that achieves **98% pitch classification accuracy**. It uses a sophisticated pipeline that includes an onset detector with **88% frame-level accuracy**, ensuring that every note is captured precisely. The model, trained on the MIR-QBSH dataset, features a Harmonic CNN -> BiLSTM architecture that analyzes a CQT spectrogram to deliver unparalleled transcription performance.

-   **`beatbox2drums`**: This service uses a powerful, onset-aware pipeline to transcribe beatboxing with **99.39% classification accuracy**. It first employs a custom CNN to detect the precise onsets of drum sounds, then feeds a small window around each onset to a second CNN that classifies it as a kick, snare, or hi-hat. This two-stage process, trained on the AVP and BaDumTss datasets, ensures rhythmic precision and clean, accurate drum patterns.

-   **The Arranger**: Our generative AI, powered by the fast and creative **Claude 4.5 Haiku**, acts as a collaborative bandmate. We guide the model with a highly sophisticated prompting architecture that provides deep musical context, strict DSL rules, and curated instrument knowledge. This allows the Arranger to generate musically coherent and inspiring arrangements that enhance the user's ideas, avoiding the generic "AI slop" and instead fostering genuine creativity.

### 🎹 The Studio: The Frontend

Developed with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**, the frontend is your interactive music studio, offering a seamless and intuitive user experience.

-   **Multi-Modal Editing**: Whether you prefer code, a piano roll, or a timeline, Phonauto has you covered. The **Monaco Editor** provides a powerful environment for editing our custom DSL, while the **Piano Roll** and **Timeline** offer live, visual editing of notes, velocity, and timing with playback scrubbing.
-   **Professional Mixing**: The **Mixer** provides track-level and master-level volume control, panning, mute, and solo functions, giving you full control over the final sound.
-   **User & Project Management**: With a full user authentication system and cloud storage, you can save your projects and access them from anywhere. Local save/load and WAV/MIDI export options are also available for easy integration with other tools.

### 🎻 The Orchestra: The Runner

Our **Node.js** and **Express**-based Runner is the unsung hero of the Phonauto ecosystem. It acts as a high-speed compilation service, taking the music DSL and transforming it into executable JavaScript for our audio engine.

This client-side synthesis approach, built on **Tone.js**, was a crucial pivot from an early plan to use a headless Sonic Pi server. The original approach proved unscalable and difficult to manage. Our current architecture is faster, more robust, and allows for near-instantaneous playback, providing the responsive and interactive experience that is central to Phonauto's design.

## Our Philosophy: Creativity First

Phonauto is designed to be a partner in the creative process. Every note generated by our AI is a suggestion, not a final decision. The user is always in control, with the power to edit, delete, or completely change any part of the composition. We believe that the future of music production lies in this powerful synergy between human intuition and artificial intelligence.

This project is more than just a tool; it's a new way to think about making music. It's for the singer who has a melody but no band, the producer who wants to sketch out ideas quickly, and anyone who has ever felt that the complexity of traditional software was a barrier to their creativity.

Welcome to Phonauto. Let's make some music.
